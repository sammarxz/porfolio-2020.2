# Portfolio v2020.2
In this 2020.2 version of my portfolio, I decided to go for a simpler thing, just an orderly gallery with my projects (there are still some to add), each image below the other with only one counter displaying. I used Gatsby for its simplicity and speed, I liked it and already supported the project. I used Sanity Studio as my data supply dashboard via GraphQL. And of course I could not leave out my simple animations with gsap, which I used for the first time in a React project.
